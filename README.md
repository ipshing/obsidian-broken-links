# Broken Links (a plugin for Obsidian)

Locate internal links in your vault that are not connected to any files. This searches all files in your vault and even checks for broken links to headings and blocks.

## How to use

Open the Broken Links view using the ribbon icon or command palette, then click on any link shown. The note containing the link will be opened so you can edit it or create a corresponding note using the built-in commands/context menus.

### Folder View

The folder view mimics the file browser layout allowing you to find broken links in an organized listing. Counts of broken links are displayed to help identify areas of your vault that need the most attention.

### File View

If you don't have many files with broken links this view can eliminate a level of navigation by forgoing the folder portion. Files can be sorted alphabetically or by how broken links are in the file.

### Link View

This view collates all brokn links by the link name, showing which files they appear in. They can be sorted by name or by occurrences.
